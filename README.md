# Polymarket Gamma Starter

> Local-first, human-in-the-loop Polymarket research, paper trading, risk review, execution-readiness, and audit platform.

## Overview

Polymarket Gamma Starter is a local-first operator console designed to help traders, researchers, developers, and system architects build disciplined prediction-market workflows before risking real capital.

The platform emphasizes:

- Research-first decision making
- Evidence collection and scoring
- Paper trading and simulation
- Risk management and preflight validation
- Auditability and operational accountability
- Human approval workflows
- Staged live-readiness evaluation
- Fail-closed execution controls

This project intentionally prioritizes operator visibility, process discipline, and safety over automation.

Version 1.0.1-real ships with extensive safeguards that keep live execution disabled by default and require deliberate operator action before any live trading workflow can occur.

# Philosophy

Most trading systems focus on execution.

Polymarket Gamma Starter focuses on decision quality.

The goal is not to automate trading.
Version 1.6.0-real ships with extensive safeguards that keep live execution disabled by default and require deliberate operator action before any live trading workflow can occur.
The goal is to create a structured environment where operators can:

1. Research markets
2. Gather evidence
3. Evaluate risk
4. Simulate outcomes
5. Review approvals
6. Audit decisions
7. Progress through controlled execution stages

Every stage is visible.

Every stage is reviewable.

Every stage can be audited.

## Live Readiness Framework

The platform includes a staged live-readiness architecture that allows operators to evaluate execution pathways without immediately enabling live trading.

Stages include:

- Configuration readiness
- Order intent creation
- Preflight validation
- Authorization review
- Execution packet generation
- Dry-run validation
- Adapter request review
- Manual execution review

Live execution remains disabled by default.

# Safety Model

This project follows a fail-closed design philosophy.

Default behavior includes:

- Live trading disabled
- Real network access disabled
- Submit disabled
- Cancel disabled
- Autonomous live trading disabled
- Scheduler disabled
- Kill switch enabled

The safest state is the default state.

The software is intentionally designed to block unsafe actions until operators deliberately enable and validate every required gate.

```

---

# First Run

1. Open the application.
2. Visit `/setup`.
3. Create an administrator account.
4. Log in.
5. Review runtime configuration.
6. Verify health status.
7. Confirm:

```text
LIVE DISABLED
REAL NETWORK DISABLED
SUBMIT DISABLED
CANCEL DISABLED
KILL SWITCH ACTIVE
```

These are expected defaults.

# Operational Workflow

A typical workflow:

```text
Research Market
      ↓
Collect Evidence
      ↓
Create Ticket
      ↓
Run Preflight
      ↓
Risk Review
      ↓
Approval
      ↓
Paper Trade
      ↓
Manage Position
      ↓

# Autonomous Trading

Autonomous live trading is NOT enabled in Version 1.6.0-real.


The platform supports:

- Signal recording
- Strategy evaluation
- Dry-run workflows
- Fake adapter workflows

It does not enable unrestricted autonomous live execution.

---

# Security

Never commit:

```text
.env
data/users.json
data/session_secret.txt
data/live/*
data/paper/*
.venv/
__pycache__/
```

Always:

- Use strong passwords
- Restrict network access
- Back up encrypted data
- Keep credentials local
- Review logs before sharing
