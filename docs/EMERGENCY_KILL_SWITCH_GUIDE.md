# Emergency and Kill Switch Guide — v2.0.0-real

The emergency posture is conservative by default.

## Default kill switch

```env
POLYMARKET_LIVE_KILL_SWITCH=true
READ_ONLY=true
POLYMARKET_LIVE_ENABLE_SUBMIT=false
POLYMARKET_LIVE_MANUAL_SUBMIT_ENABLED=false
```

With this posture, live submission is blocked.

## Emergency actions

`POST /api/v2/live/emergency` supports:

- `force_read_only`
- `disable_new_live_orders`
- `record_kill_switch`
- `cancel_all_preview`

These actions are audited. They intentionally do not secretly mutate `.env` or process environment in the background, because hidden mutation could make the operator misunderstand the actual launch state. Persist emergency settings through `/settings/configuration` or by editing local `.env` deliberately.

## Recommended emergency `.env` posture

```env
POLYMARKET_V2_TRADING_MODE=live_read_only
READ_ONLY=true
POLYMARKET_LIVE_KILL_SWITCH=true
POLYMARKET_LIVE_ENABLE_SUBMIT=false
POLYMARKET_LIVE_MANUAL_SUBMIT_ENABLED=false
POLYMARKET_LIVE_ENABLE_CANCEL=true
POLYMARKET_LIVE_MANUAL_CANCEL_ENABLED=true
```

This posture blocks new orders while preserving a path for deliberate targeted cancellation if the operator enables cancel gates and confirms each action.
